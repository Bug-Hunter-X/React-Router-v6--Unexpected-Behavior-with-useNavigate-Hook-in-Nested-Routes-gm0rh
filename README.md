# React Router v6 Navigation Issue with useNavigate Hook

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in React Router v6 when using the `useNavigate` hook to navigate from a nested route back to its parent route.  The parent component doesn't re-render as expected, leading to stale data or UI inconsistencies. The issue is caused by an unexpected interaction between `useNavigate` and the routing lifecycle in React Router v6. This is a simplified example of a complex scenario that could cause similar problems in larger applications.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Navigate to the `/about` page.
5. Navigate to a nested route such as `/about/nested`.
6. Navigate back to the `/about` using the back button or programmatically. The about component should re-render but it will not. 

## Potential Solutions and Workarounds

Several approaches can help to mitigate this issue:

* **Using `useLocation` hook:** The `useLocation` hook could be used along with `useEffect` to trigger re-renders, allowing the component to update correctly.
* **Force rerender using key props**: adding a unique key to the component every time the route changes.
* **Using a different navigation method:** Consider exploring alternative navigation techniques if the `useNavigate` hook continues to present challenges in your application.
